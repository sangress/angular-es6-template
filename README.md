# angular-es6-template
A simple AngularJS ES6 template for a fast start.
The use for semamtic-ui is optional you can use any css-framework that you like, this is just for example.<br />
We use Angular 1.4 so it can be "production ready" but it can be replaced with Angular 2 with small changes.

Start here:
```
npm i
```

Then:
```
gulp dev
```

cd the dist folder that was created by gulp and run a simple-server from there to view your app, you can use live-server or python's simpleHTTPServer.
